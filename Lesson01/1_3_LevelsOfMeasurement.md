# Lesson 1.3 Levels of Measurement
## Reading
Reading sections are from the [Introductory Statistics Textbook](../Resources/OpenIntroTextbook.pdf)
* 1.2.2 Types of Variables (pages 12-13)

## Lesson
We can distinguish variables by what they measure. There are 4 __levels of measurement__: Nominal (the base level, describing most basic information), Ordinal, Interval, Ratio (the highest level with the most information).

| __Level__ | __Summary__ |
| :---- | :------ |
| __Ratio__ (Highest) | Gives information with a numerical order<br>(Zero has a meaning) |
| __Interval__	      | Gives information with a numerical order<br>(No absolute zero)<br>(Zero is just a reference point) |
| __Ordinal__         | Gives information with an order |
| __Nominal__ (Base Level) | Gives information |

## Practice
Here are a few variables. Determine if they are Quantitative or Categorical, then determine the level of measurement of each variable. Once you have identified the level of measurement, move your mouse over each variable to see the answer.
