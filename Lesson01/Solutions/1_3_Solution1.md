## Problem 1.3.1:
Determine the Level of Measure for the variable "Age"

__Age__ is generally a __ratio__ variable
* Numerical variable
* There is a definite zero (the moment someone was born) - An age of 0 means there is no age.

*Note* that if Age is used to separate people into groups (such as ages 0-3, 4-7, 8-12, etc.), then this is categorizing people. It would then be an __Ordinal__ variable.
