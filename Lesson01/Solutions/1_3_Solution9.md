## Problem 1.3.9
__Zip Code__ is a __Nominal__ variable.
* Used to identify an object/grade (in this case, a region)
* Even though it is a number, the number only identifies the group
  * Could easily use letters as a Zip Code: 1AB3E instead of 11235
* There is no natural order (a Zip Code of 24667 is not "higher" than 23532) - You can rearrange them and it won't change the meaning
