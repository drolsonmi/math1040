# Lesson 1 The Nature of Data
In statistics, we are working with data. __Data__ are a collection of observations.
* (Side-note: A single observation is known as a datum. Multiple observations, or a collection of observations, are known as data)

In __Statistics__, we are trying to find __*the best way to collect, analyze, and draw conclusions from data*__.

Consider the following data table of student exam scores:

| __Student__ | __Exam 1__ | __Exam 2__ | __Exam 3__ | __Final Exam__ |
| :---------- | :--------: | :--------: | :--------: | :------------: |
| __A101__    | 97         | 92         | 94         | 90             | 
| __A053__    | 87         | 78         | 89         | 86             | 
| __A113__    | 84         | 86         | 86         | 83             | 
| __A254__    | 73         | 69         | 79         | 72             | 

Each student is considered an __observation__, depicted by the rows of the table.

Each measurement is known as a __variable__, depicted by the columns of the table.

In this lesson, we are going to explore what variables are as well as the different types of variables we will deal with through the course.
