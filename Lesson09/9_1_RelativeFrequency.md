## Relative Frequency
### Example 1
| Roll | Count | Relative Frequency |
| :---: | :---: | :--- |
| 1 | 83 | 83/279  =  0.297  =  29.7% |
| 2 | 48 | 48/279  =  0.172  =  17.2% |
| 3 | 27 | 27/279  =  0.097  =  9.7% |
| 4 | 12 | 12/279  =  0.043  =  4.3% |
| 5 | 76 | 76/279  =  0.272  =  27.2% |
| 6 | 33 | 33/279  =  0.118  =  11.8% |

### Example 2
| Grade | Count | Relative Frequency |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| Freshman | 4 | 4/15  =  0.267  =  26.7% |
| Sophomore | 8 | 8/15  =  0.533  =  53.3%
| Junior | 2 | 2/15  =  0.133  =  13.3% |
| Senior | 1 | 1/15  =  0.067  =  6.7%  |

# Practice
## Practice Question 3
A survey was conducted to find out people's preferred type of pet. The results are as follows:
* Dogs: 40 people
* Cats: 25 people
* Birds: 10 people
* Fish: 15 people
* Reptiles: 10 people

After calculating the relative frequencies, compare your answers to the answer for practice question 3.

### Answer to Practice Question 3
A total of 100 people were questioned.

| Pet Type | Count | Relative Frequency |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| Dogs | 40 | 40/100  =  0.400  = 40.0% |
| Cats | 25 | 25/100  =  0.250 =  25.0% |
| Birds | 10 | 10/100  =  0.100  =  10.0% |
| Fish | 15 | 15/100  =  0.150  =  15.0% |
| Reptiles | 10 | 10/100  =  0.100  =  10.0% |
