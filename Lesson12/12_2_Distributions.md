# 12.2 Distributions

## Reading

## Lesson
Having learned about probability distributions, let's take a look at a few different distributions that we have or will learn about.

#### Uniform
The most basic distribution is a __uniform distribution__. In this distribution, all categories have the same probability.

* Show a table and a graph of a uniform probability distribution

#### Normal Distribution
The distribution that is most useful in statistics is the __normal distribution__. This is most important as we get into the last half of the course.

A normal distribution is characterized with a high probability in the center. This center marks the mean, median, and mode of the data (see Lesson 6 on Measures of Center). The probabilities taper to lower probabilities as the data gets further from the mean.

* Show a graph of a normal probability distribution

We'll study more about normal distributions after the midterm exam.

#### Skewed (Left or Right)
A __left-skewed distribution__ is almost a normal distribution, but have extra data left of the mode, thus shifting the mean and median to the left.

* Show a graph of a left-skewed distribution

A __right-skewed distribution__ is almost a normal distribution, but have extra data right of the mode, thus shifting the mean and median to the right.

* Show a graph of a right-skewed distribution

#### Binomial
The next distribution we will be discussing (Lessons 13-14) is the __binomial distribution__. This is characterized by only having two possible outcomes - either a success or a failure. For example, if we want to study how many students play sports by taking a sample of 20 students, the binomial distribution shows,
* the probability that 1 of the 20 students plays a sport
* the probability that 2 of the 20 students plays a sport
* the probability that 3 of the 20 students plays a sport
* the probability that 4 of the 20 students plays a sport
* etc.

* Show a graph of a binomial distribution
