## Practice
2. The average length of a particular set of books written by authors around the world is 425 pages with a standard devation of 32 pages. Looking at authors specifically from South Africa, a sample of 36 of these books has an average length of 410 pages. What is the margin of error with a 90% confidence level?

We are given the population parameters:
* $\mu$ = 425
* $\sigma$ = 32

We are also given information about the sample:
* $\bar{x}$ = 410
* $n$ = 36

The critical value for a 90% confidence level is 1.645. The margin of error then is,
$$E = z\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} = 1.645\frac{32}{\sqrt{36}} = \frac{1.645\cdot 32}{6} = \mathbf{8.77}$$

The confidence interval then is between the two values,
* $\bar{x} + E =$ 410 + 8.77 = 418.77
* $\bar{x} - E =$ 410 - 8.77 = 401.23
