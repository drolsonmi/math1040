## Practice
3. Bottles of soda are to be filled with 2.00 liters, allowing some room for error giving a standard deviation of 0.15 liters. Calculate the margin of error for a sample of 54 of these bottles with an average volume of 1.95 liters at a 99% confidence level.

We are given the population parameters:
* $\mu$ = 2.00
* $\sigma$ = 0.15

We are also given information about the sample:
* $\bar{x}$ = 1.95
* $n$ = 54

The critical value for a 99% confidence level is 2.58. The margin of error then is,
$$E = z\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} = 2.58\frac{0.15}{\sqrt{54}} = \mathbf{0.053}$$

The confidence interval then is between the two values,
* $\bar{x} + E =$ 1.95 + 0.053 = 2.003
* $\bar{x} - E =$ 1.95 - 0.053 = 1.897
