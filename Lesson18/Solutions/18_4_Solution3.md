## Practice
3. A national education researcher wants to estimate the average SAT Math score for high school seniors in a particular state. The population standard deviation is known to be 100 points. What sample size is needed to get a margin of error less than 25 for a 92% confidence interval?

## Solution
From the problem we get the following information:
* A confidence interval of 92% has a critical value of $$z_c = 1.75$$
* The population standard deviation is $$\sigma=100$$
* The desired margin of error is $$E = 25$$

$$n = \left(\frac{z_c \sigma}{E}\right)^2 \left(\frac{1.75\cdot 100}{25}\right)^2 = 49$$

Since this is an exact number, we don't need to round up. __The required sample size is at least 49__.
