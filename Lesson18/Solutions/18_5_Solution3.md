## Practice
A professor surveys 41 students about how many hours they studied for the last exam. The sample mean is 14.2 hours, and the sample standard deviation is 4.6 hours. Construct a 95% confidence interval for the true mean number of hours students studied for the exam.

## Solution
From the problem we get the following information:
* A confidence level of 95%
* Sample Size is $$n=41$$
* The sample mean is $$\bar{x} = 14.2$$
* The sample standard deviation is $$s=4.6$$

First, __verify the central limit theorem__
* Is the sample random? __No__ (We cannot assume this from the problem)
* Is the sample large enough? __Yes__ (sample size is at least 30)

At this point, __we can't solve the problem because the Central Limit Thereom does not hold.__
