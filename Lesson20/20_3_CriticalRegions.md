# Lesson 20.3 Critical Regions
## Reading

## Lesson




#### Level of Significance




#### Left-tailed, Right-tailed, and Two-tailed tests
We saw in 20.1 that there are 3 different possible Alternate Hypotheses we can choose from:
1. The true value is greater than the null value

$$H_A: \mu > \mu_0$$

2. The true value is less than the null value

$$H_A: \mu < \mu_0$$

3. The true value is different from the null value

$$H_A: \mu \ne \mu_0$$

(Discuss the three test types and their relationship to the level of significance)




#### The Critical Region



#### Using the Test Statistic and the Critical Region



#### Example
Let's revisit and solve the example brought up in 20.1:

> American mental abilities are often measured by an IQ test.  The IQ distribution is normal with a mean of 100 and a population standard deviation of 15. A random sample of 40 Snow College students is taken and they have an average IQ of 106.3. Can we say with a 5% level of significance that the true average IQ of Snow College students is higher than the nation?

To solve, let's do the following:
1. Make sure the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) holds
2. Define our hypotheses
3. Find the critical region
4. Find the test statistic

<div popover id="Problem_1">

## Problem 20.3.1
A popover is an element that is placed on top of everything else.
* Item 1
* Item 2

$$\bar{x}=\frac{1}{n}\sum x$$
It can be used when you want to tell something important.

</div>

<div popover id="Problem_2">

## Problem 20.3.2
A popover is an element that is placed on top of everything else.
* Item 1
* Item 2

$$\bar{x}=\frac{1}{n}\sum x$$
It can be used when you want to tell something important.

## Problem 20.3.3
A popover is an element that is placed on top of everything else.
* Item 1
* Item 2

$$\bar{x}=\frac{1}{n}\sum x$$
It can be used when you want to tell something important.
